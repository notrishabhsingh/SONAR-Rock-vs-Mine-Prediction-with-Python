# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-with-Python
Hello Friends , In this project , I have built a system in Python that can predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. For this, we are using Logistic Regression Model for our prediction. 
We will be doing our Python Programming in Google Colaboratory which is a free cloud based system where you can write your python scripts , Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs.

the Work Flow of this Project will be ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed0036c3-e0ec-4940-b1f3-ea5d17e72ee2)
